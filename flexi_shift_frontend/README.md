# FLEXI SHIFT 
**Project By:** Susie Gordon

## Technologies Used
- Django
- Google Fonts
- Lottie Files
- Postman
- Python

## Approach
My initial approach was to make a call to the backend by successfully implementing a 'shift' model with full CRUD capabilities. In order to fully render the CRUD functionalities, the backend url was imported to make the proper requests to load relevant data and initiate corresponding actions which then were passed into the routers.js file. This file would be the roadmap to guide how each page of the app would be painted using the 'pages' and 'components' folders. 

## Installation
- `Fork` and `clone` this respository
- `cd` into the directory on your local machine
- Open this repository in your code editor and run the code `npm start` to open the React app in your browser

## Issues 
1. Unable to implement authentication
    - Utilized the register & login forms already packaged by Django but the backend was unable to receive the requests rendering the auth feature incomplete; Commented out my attempt.


## Future Enhancements
- Add authentication for admin and individual users
- Implement an interactive calendar
- Color coding for each employee
- Add a list of preset icons for each user to choose from
